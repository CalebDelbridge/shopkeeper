# Shopkeeper

#### Description of project

Shopkeeper is a discord bot that provides a simple to use shopping system so customers can easily view and purchase various products from multiple sellers.

#### What problem does this solve

Shopkeeper solves the issue of payments being delivered to the wrong seller or a wrong amount by keeping track of the products you put in your cart and calculating how much you need to pay to what seller.

#### What problems did I face during this project

• Adding and removing items from the cart based on the reactions on the product message & showing the result in the cart

• Working with partial messages & reactions if the bot restarted

#### Does the project work

Yes! Shopkeeper does work and was fully completed to my liking solving the main issue it was intended to solve

#### Self Hosting

This project can be self-hosted by anyone with basic javascript programming skills. Shopkeeper uses a MongoDB database along with mongoose to keep all its data.
